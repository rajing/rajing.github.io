      Hi, my name is Rajin Gill and I am currently pursuing my degree at Western Governers University. This website was created to demonstrate my understanding of HTML concepts for [EUP1] Web Development Fundamentals.

            Create an original layout template for your website by adhering to the guidelines below:
            <br>
            <br>
            Note: The layout of your main elements will remain the same on each page, but you will customize the content on each of the subpages.
            <br>
            <br>
            Note: You will be required to submit a hand-drawn or computer-generated sketch of the main layout template for your website on the attached “Student Project Submission Form.” The sketch should match the layout of your elements.
